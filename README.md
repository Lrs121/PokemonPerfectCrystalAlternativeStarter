# Pokemon Perfect Crystal - Original Version

When Pokemon Crystal was released, it was the ultimate experience of classic Game Boy/Game Boy Color Pokemon. Now this classic can be played the way it always should have been!

The goal of this hack has been to make an idealized definitive version of Pokemon Crystal that has every Pokemon available to catch and to fix a number of glaring glitches that hampered the original game.

This is the original version, where Red has Level 100 Pokemon and encounter rates for some added Pokemon are extremely low.

Only minor changes have been made, see below for details:

# Version 1.0 (28/01/2018):

All 251 Pokemon catchable.

Pokemon that normally evolve with trades, evolve through the use of stones.

Stones and items that could only be obtained through Mystery Gift available at department stores.

The GS Ball and Celebi event can be triggered after Mount Silver has been unlocked.

Fixed a bunch of glitches such as the problems with some of Kurt’s balls and several items.

Increased opponents levels to match HGSS (Except Red who has Level 100 Pokemon just for fun, he is supposed to be the best trainer in the world after all). This is mainly noticeable in late Johto and Kanto.

Made all Gym Leaders rematchable. Just talk to them again and they will ask for a rematch.

Removed the badge boosts and the extra chances the AI has to miss on status moves to create parity between the player and the AI.

Ho-Oh and Lugia have their signature moves when you encounter them.

Reuseable TM’s.

Hold down B to run.

Restored Japanese sprites for the Beauty, Sage, Medium, female Swimmer and Fisherman.

Simplified the clock reset procedure on the intro screen. Simply hold down “Down”, “B” and “Select”. No need to enter in a password.

# Update (29/01/2018):

Restored the original Japanese sprite for Jynx.

# Update (08/02/2018):

Tiny adjustment to a single trainer’s Pokemon levels that was missed.

# Update (25/06/2018):

The readme file has been updated with the secret locations for the legendary birds and Mew at the bottom of the document. (Keep scrolling)

# Update (18/02/2019):

Moved the 3 legendary birds to more logical locations around Johto and Kanto.

# Update (24/02/2019):

Fixed a bunch more glitches such as the Magikarp length bug, Light Ball bug and the Belly Drum glitch.

# Update (01/03/2019):

Adjusted the levels of the 3 legendary birds to have a more appropriate move set when you encounter them.

Made all but one of the unobtainable decorations unlock upon defeating the Elite 4.

Made the Gold Trophy unlock upon defeating Red.

# Update (21/03/2019):

Cleaned up the entrance to Cerulean Cave by extending the ledge on Route 4 over the water. This avoids a bug where your sprite disappears when you start surfing off the ledge.

Cleaned up the added dialogue by replacing instances of ". . ." with "…" to match the rest of the game.

# Update (05/04/2019):

Cleaned up some minor grammar mistakes in the dialogue.

#
The readme file includes a list of changed encounters and evolutions.
#
#
# The attached IPS works with Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.1) [C][!] and the patched rom should have a checksum of c448.

# Secret Locations

Articuno is in the Ice Path B3F.

Zapdos is at Route 10, outside the powerplant.

Moltres is in Mount Silver room 2.

Mew is at the summit of Mount Silver (where Red is) during the morning. I imagine that Red is up there looking for a Mew.
